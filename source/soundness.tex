    \item Decomposition of Classical Logic 
    \item Realizing constructivity keeping Duality (symmetry) intact 
    \item Resource sensitive (i.e. each hypothesize can be used exactly at once)

    Familiar connectives ``$\wedge$'' and ``$\vee$'' break into weaker four connectives:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item ``$\wedge$'' into ``$\otimes$'' and ``$\with$'' 
      \item ``$\vee$''   into ``$\parr$''   and ``$\oplus$'' 
    \end{itemize}

    Another viewpoint:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Multiplicative} are ``$\otimes$'' and ``$\parr$'' 
      \item \textit{Additive} are ``$\with$''   and ``$\oplus$'' 
    \end{itemize}

    System containing only Multiplicative and Additive is called \textit{MALL}

  First off, what is \textit{semantics}?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item To provide rigorous defnitions that abstract away from implementation
      details
    \item To provide mathematical tools for proving properties of programs
  \end{itemize}
   (Amadio, Curien)\\~\\

  Phase Semantics is a kind of semantics, which is based on the idea of \textit{Tarskian style}: \\

  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``A'' means A which is truth value (true or false)
    \item ``A $\wedge$ B'' means ``A'' and ``B''
  \end{itemize}

  and so on.\\

  This seems ovious, however, there is another semantics which is not the case: \textit{Coherent Semantics}, which is BHK style inconsistent semantics. \\

  \textit{Phase Space} is Phase Semantics for MALL.

    Sequent which are provable in MALL are all valid in Phase Space \\

    By straightforward induction on inference rules.

      \item % (i)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{identity})}
        \AxiomC{}
        \UnaryInfC{$ \vdash A, A^\bot $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        \[ A \parr A^\bot = A \multimap A \ni 1
        \]
        ($\because$ definition of identity 1)

      \item % (ii)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{true})}
        \AxiomC{}
        \UnaryInfC{$ \vdash \Gamma, \top $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        \[
          \Gamma \parr \top = \textbf{0} \multimap \Gamma 
        \]
        Since $\textbf{0}$ is the smallest fact, $\textbf{0} \subseteq \Gamma$.
        This implies $\forall z, z \in \textbf{0} \Rightarrow z \in \Gamma$.
        Hence $\forall z, z \in \textbf{0} \Rightarrow 1z \in \Gamma$. \\
        $\therefore$ By definition of ``$\multimap$'',
        $1 \in \textbf{0} \multimap \Gamma = \Gamma \parr \top$

      \item % (iii)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{one})}
        \AxiomC{}
        \UnaryInfC{$ \vdash \textbf{1} $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        Oviously,
        \[
         1 \in \{1\} \subseteq \{1\}^{\bot\bot} = \textbf{1}
        \]

      \item % (iv)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{cut})}
        \AxiomC{$\vdash \Gamma, A$}
        \AxiomC{$\vdash A^\bot, \Delta$}
        \BinaryInfC{$\vdash \Gamma, \Delta$}
        \DisplayProof \\
        We have to show that if $1 \in \Gamma \parr A$ and $1 \in A^\bot \parr \Delta$
        then $1 \in \Gamma \parr \Delta$. In fact this is equivalent to
        \begin{align*}
                     & 1 \in \Gamma^\bot \multimap A, 1 \in A \multimap \Delta \\
         \Rightarrow & 1 \in \Gamma^\bot \multimap \Delta
        \end{align*}
         This is easily followed by
        \begin{align*}
                     & \Gamma^\bot \subseteq A, A \subseteq \Delta \\
         \Rightarrow & \Gamma^\bot \subseteq \Delta
        \end{align*}

        \AxiomC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A, B, \Delta $}
        \UnaryInfC{$ \vdash \Gamma, B, A, \Delta $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        $\because$ ``$\land$'' is commutative.

      \item % (vi)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{with})}
        \AxiomC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A $}
        \AxiomC{$ \vdash \Gamma, B $}
        \BinaryInfC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A \with B $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        We have to show that if $1 \in \Gamma \parr A$ and $1 \in \Gamma \parr B$
        then $1 \in \Gamma \parr (A \with B)$.
        Here we use distributivity of $\parr$ over $\with$: \\
        \[ (\Gamma \parr A) \with (\Gamma \parr B) = \Gamma \parr (A \with B) \]
        By definition of $\with$ and hypothesis, left hand side contains $1$,
        and so does right hand side.

      \item % (vii)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{left plus})}
        \AxiomC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A $}

        \UnaryInfC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A \oplus B $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        Similarly, we use half-distributivity of $\parr$ over $\oplus$: \\
        \[ (\Gamma \parr A) \oplus (\Gamma \parr B) \subseteq \Gamma \parr (A \oplus B) \]
      \item % (viii)

        \UnaryInfC{$ \vdash \Gamma, \bot $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        \[ \Gamma \parr \bot = \textbf{1} \multimap \Gamma \]
        By definition, \textbf{1} is the smallest fact contains $1$
        i. e. $\textbf{1} \subseteq \Gamma$
        so that $\forall e, e \in \textbf{1} \Rightarrow e = 1e \in \Gamma$
        hence $1 \in \textbf{1} \multimap \Gamma$.

      \item % (ix)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{times})}
        \AxiomC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A $}
        \AxiomC{$ \vdash \Delta, B $}
        \BinaryInfC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A \otimes B, \Delta $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        We have to show that if $1 \in \Gamma \parr A$ and $1 \in \Delta \parr B$
        then $1 \in \Gamma \parr \Delta \parr (A \otimes B)$.
        Hypotheses can be transformed into
        $1 \in \Gamma^\bot \multimap A$ and $1 \in \Delta^\bot \multimap B$ respectively.
        Therefore, we have $\Gamma^\bot \subseteq A$ and $\Delta^\bot \subseteq B$
        \begin{align*}
          & \Rightarrow \Gamma^\bot.\Delta^\bot \subseteq A.B \\
          & \Rightarrow (\Gamma^\bot.\Delta^\bot)^{\bot\bot} \subseteq (A.B)^{\bot\bot} \\
          & \Rightarrow \Gamma^\bot \otimes \Delta^\bot \subseteq A \otimes B \\
          & \Rightarrow \Gamma^\bot \otimes \Delta^\bot \multimap A \otimes B \ni 1 \\
          & \Rightarrow \Gamma \parr \Delta \parr (A \otimes B) \ni 1
        \end{align*}

      \item % (x)
        \RightLabel{(\textit{par})}
        \AxiomC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A, B $}
        \UnaryInfC{$ \vdash \Gamma, A \parr B $}
        \DisplayProof \\
        This is tautology. \hfill $\square$
